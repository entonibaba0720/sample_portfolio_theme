# Simple Sample Portfolio Template

This is an improved version one of Traversy Media's project. This is a project with Bootstrap 3.4.0.
I used Npm instead of Bower. 
This project is the first of my theme with Sass and I really enjoyed it. I learned how to use variables and the Sass syntax. If you like the site, use it.

## Original template
I find this project on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7EwxwSfVk&list=LLbWAlv8rdTiGw0IgSZLfHlg&t=0s&index=4

I didn't focus on the exact copying, I made minor changes in some places, but I think it's pretty much the same.

Have a great day! :)
